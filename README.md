# Portfolio

**This Portfolio has been created to showcase all of my work through Bellevue’s Data Science Program. Presented below are 10 Projects that represent my skills. All images are linked to each project’s Github Page.**

## Project 1 - Fake News Detection

Fake news for various business and political purposes has been appearing in large numbers and extensive in the online world. Identify the fake news at right time and improving the trustworthiness of information in online social networks. Using different principles and methodologies to detect the fake news in the dataset is the aim of this project. Also addresses the unknown challenges of fake news and diverse connections among news articles, and subjects. 

## Project 2 - House price prediction

Housing market trends and forecasts shows an extraordinarily strong real estate market, with strong housing demand in every part of the country. The improved economy and millennials entering their peak home buying years are fueling a residential housing boom. Along with this, low mortgage rates, combined with an increase in working from home because of the pandemic, have spurred a surge in housing demand, particularly in lower-density suburbs. In 2020, more existing homes were sold than in any other years since 2006.

## Project 3 - Air Travel Safety

Driving is more dangerous, with more than 5 million accidents compared to 20 accidents in flying. As per the comparison motor vehicle accident to be 1 in 98 for a lifetime. For air and space transport, the odds were 1 in 7K for a lifetime. Due to perception, it may feel that flying is more dangerous, but the fact is different. Another reason is plane crashes are catastrophic like killing more people at once. Other accidents happen every day and spread the loss over time, making their combined effects less noticeable.

## Project 4 - Stock Price Prediction

Prediction of stock market performance is one of the most difficult things to do. There are so many factors involved in the prediction – physical factors vs. physhological, rational and irrational behavior, etc. All these aspects combine to make share prices instable and very difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy. Stock price forecast is the most crucial component for investors and companies to predict future revenues and any possible negative earnings. The essence of the stock market investments involves high risk and high profits; thus, it is a source of attraction to many businesses, investors and economists.
